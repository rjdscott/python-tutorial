# Intro to Pandas

It is easy to upgrade your workflows from Excel to python with Pandas.

There will be a slight learning curve - as with learning anything new - however,
the investment will be invaluable.

You can think of the python package Pandas as excel in code. The notebooks contained hetherin
will show you not only how to replicate some common excel formulas, but how to expand your
thinking when it comes to data ingestion, cleaning and analysis.

We will be using the very popular Jupyter Notebook as the place where we will write our code
and view out outputs
